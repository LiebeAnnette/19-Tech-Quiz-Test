# 19-Tech-Quiz-Test

edX Bootcamp Homework Challenge 19 - Testing

## Description

This homework assignment provided a fully functional Tech Quiz application, and the challenge was to enhance it with both component and end-to-end (E2E) tests using Cypress. The app is built with the MERN stack â€” featuring a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API â€” and allows users to take a quiz of ten random questions and view their final score.
